\label{ch0i_Abstract}
\quad With the advancements in technology, parallel processing platforms such as graphics processing units (GPUs), massively parallel processor arrays (MPPAs) and multi-core processors are gaining popularity for accelerated execution of compute-intensive applications. However the performance gains achieved by adding more cores inside a computing platform come at the cost of rapidly scaling complexities to the inter-core communication, memory coherency and, most importantly, the power consumption. Increasing the operating frequency or the number of cores does not yield the performance desired for the current complex, compute-intensive applications. This calls for heterogeneous architectures that achieve the desired performance by integrating specialized processing abilities required for specific tasks, after extensive analysis of an application and its performance demands. For example, the performance demand for first convolution layer in MNIST digit classifier is 300 million multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations per second for sub-millisecond latency, which can go up to 300 billion MAC/s for sub-microsecond latency. 
\newline This report intends to investigate two compute-intensive applications, namely MNIST Digit classifier using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). For MNIST-CNN, we observe the performance of 24 million MAC/s on Intel Core i3 running at 2.3 GHz using a single-threaded C++ code which can go up to 2 billion MAC/s using OpenCL on the same platform. To achieve sub-microsecond latency, 20 convolution engines (running at 600 MHz) can be used where each engine is able to produce one pixel by performing 25 MAC operations every clock cycle. The peak performance of such a hypothetical engine is 300 billion MAC/s. A similar analysis is presented for the second application (FHE). Apart from the theoretical analysis, experiments pertaining to architectural and algorithmic explorations are also carried out for these two applications.
