\quad After nearly 40 years of pondering over CPU power and performance, Dr. David Patterson from Berkeley put forth the Three walls namely, the Power Wall, ILP (Instruction Level Parallelism) Wall and the Memory Wall, which marked the end of single-core computing systems\cite{mem_wall}. While ILP Wall presented the diminishing returns from aggressive pipelining in superscalars, Power Wall revealed an exponential increase in power consumption with operating frequency. Memory wall projected the gap between compute bandwidth and memory bandwidth, which could not be bridged with increasing cache sizes and optimizations. With the emergence of multiple identical cores (Multicores of the sub-micron era) on a single chip came a new set of challenges, such as scalability, parallel software availability and power limit \cite{moore2011data}.\newline

Recent research efforts have unveiled the strengths of heterogeneous computing platforms which are more than just differences in Instruction Set Architectures. Heterogeneous systems have gradually evolved with time to System-On-Chips, integrating the previously discrete components onto a single chip. There are several aspects to be addressed to harness the full potential of GPUs and FPGAs in mainstream computing applications. Hardware accelerators provide greater efficiency in realizing a design compared to software counterparts, with improved power economics. With growing complexity of the architectures, there is a pressing need for engineers to come up with better design decisions and partition the application suitably between hardware and software, to avoid any performance bottlenecks. \newline

This report deals with identification of such compute-intensive applications which can be offloaded to hardware accelerators, efficient partitioning of application between hardware and software and gauging of the various design points to achieve specific optimization goals.
